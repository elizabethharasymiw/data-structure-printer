# Data Structure Printer
A program designed to help visualize different data structures in a command line setting.

## Design Notes
- Many of the print functions used in this code were formatted in a way that helped with their ability to be copied and pasted into a different code base to help visualize the data structures you are debugging.
- The initial intent was focused on LeetCode debugging, which is why the code is indented using 4 spaces, and a couple of external code snippets are copied from LeetCode.
